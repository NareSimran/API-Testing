Test Plan for Number Conversion Service
Created by:Simran Nare
Date: 02-03-2025

1. Objective
The goal of this test plan is to verify the functionality, quality, and reliability of the Number Conversion Web Service available at https://www.dataaccess.com/webservicesserver/NumberConversion.wso. This web service converts a given number into its word form. The objective is to ensure that the service behaves as expected across a variety of valid, invalid, and edge cases.

2. Scope
The scope of this test plan includes the following:

Features to be Tested
Conversion of numbers to words (valid and edge cases).
Proper SOAP request and response handling.
Response validation and content correctness.
API's ability to handle valid and invalid inputs.
Types of Testing
Manual Testing
Automated Testing
Performance Testing
Security Testing
Test Environments
Operating Systems: Windows 10, macOS, Linux
Browsers: Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Microsoft Edge
Devices: Desktop computers, laptops, smartphones
Network Connectivity: Wi-Fi, cellular, wired connections
Security Protocols: HTTPS, Valid SSL certificates
Access Permissions: Testing with valid credentials (if required)

3. Inclusions
Introduction: Overview of testing the Number Conversion service, which accepts a number and returns it as a word-form output in XML format.
Test Objectives: Verifying that the service converts numbers accurately and handles errors properly.
Functional Tests: Basic functionality and edge cases (i.e., negative numbers, large numbers, etc.)


4. Exclusions
Testing non-number inputs such as special characters, alphanumeric strings, etc. (to be treated as invalid inputs).
Stress testing the API under extreme load beyond normal use cases.


5. Test Environments
Operating Systems: Windows 10, macOS, Linux
Browsers: Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Microsoft Edge
Devices: Desktop computers, laptops, smartphones
Network Connectivity: Wi-Fi, cellular, wired connections
Security Protocols: HTTPS, SSL certificates
Access Permissions: Based on API's access control (if any)


6. Defect Reporting Procedure
Defect Identification: Any deviation from the expected output or behavior.
Defect Reporting:
Report using JIRA or another tracking tool.
Provide detailed steps, screenshots, or logs to reproduce the issue.
Classify defects based on severity (Critical, High, Medium, Low).
Tracking Tools: JIRA, Bugzilla, or similar tools.
Roles and Responsibilities:
Test Lead: Oversee testing, review reports.
Testers: Execute test cases, log defects.


Developers: Fix defects.
7. Test Strategy
Test Scenario Creation
Techniques:
Equivalence Class Partitioning (for valid/invalid number inputs).
Boundary Value Analysis (edge cases like 0, 1, negative numbers).
Decision Table Testing (for different ranges of numbers).
State Transition Testing (for different input states).
Testing Procedure
Smoke Testing: Basic functionality check for converting small and large numbers.
In-depth Testing: Detailed test cases based on valid, invalid, and edge case inputs.
Performance Testing: Measure API response time and its behavior under load.
Regression Testing: Ensuring no breaks in functionality after fixes.
Exploratory Testing: Random and unexpected inputs to test robustness.


8. Test Schedule
Test Plan Creation: [Start Date] - [End Date]
Test Case Creation: [Start Date] - [End Date]
Test Case Execution: [Start Date] - [End Date]
Test Report: [End Date]


9. Test Deliverables
Test Cases: Detailed test cases document in Excel/Word format.
Test Execution Report: Results of executed tests.
Defect Report: A list of defects found during testing.
Test Summary Report: Summary of test execution, defects, and overall quality assessment.


10. Entry and Exit Criteria
Entry Criteria
Test environment set up.
Requirements and test cases signed off.
Testable build or service available.
Exit Criteria
All test cases executed.
All critical defects fixed.
Test reports ready for review and submission.


11. Tools
Defect Tracking Tools: JIRA
Test Case Management: Excel, Google Sheets
Performance Tools: Apache JMeter
Automation Tools: Postman (for API testing)
SOAP Testing Tools: SOAP UI


12. Risks and Mitigations
Possible Risks:
Non-Availability of Resource: In case of tester unavailability, resource replacement.
Slow Response Time: If the API responds slowly, perform load testing and optimize.
Mitigations:
Use backup resources and pre-configured environments for faster execution.
Use monitoring tools to track performance issues.
